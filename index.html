    <div id="p1">
    <img src="seeds.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="250px">
    <p class="p1">Seed Selection:</p>
    <p class="b1"> Choose high-quality bhindi seeds from a reputable supplier or seed store. Look for seeds that are fresh and free from any signs of damage or disease.</p>

    <p class="p1">Seed Sowing:</p>
    <p class="b1">Bhindi can be directly sown in the field or started indoors and later transplanted. For direct sowing, wait until the last frost date has passed and the soil temperature has warmed up to around 60-65°F (15-18°C). Plant the seeds about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep and 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) apart, depending on the variety.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="p1">
        <img src="Irrigation.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="250px">
        <p class="p1">Land Preparation:</p>
        <p class="b1">Prepare the field by plowing or tilling the soil to a depth of 8-10 inches (20-25 cm). Remove any weeds, rocks, or debris and incorporate well-rotted compost or organic matter to improve soil fertility and structure.</p>

        <p class="p1">Irrigation:</p>
        <p class="b1"> After sowing the seeds, provide enough water to keep the soil consistently moist until the seedlings emerge. Once established, water the bhindi plants regularly, aiming to provide about 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) of water per week.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="p1">
        <img src="fertilizers.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="250px">
        <p class="p1">Fertilization:</p>
        <p class="b1">Bhindi plants benefit from regular fertilization. Apply balanced fertilizers that are rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Follow the recommended dosage as per the manufacturer's instructions or based on soil test results.</p>

        <p class="p1">Pest and Disease Management:</p>
        <p class="b1">Keep a close eye on the bhindi plants for signs of pests or diseases. Implement appropriate pest control measures, such as using organic pesticides or natural predators, to manage common bhindi pests like aphids, fruit borers, and whiteflies.</p>
